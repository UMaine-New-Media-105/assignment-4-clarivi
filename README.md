In this assignment, we were tasked with using loops and arrays to create a complex patterned background. I chose to used fireworks as my main inspiration

In Q1, we created the base pattern that would be used for each 'tile'. The sketch can be found at: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/vGJAdpAZT

In Q2, we made that pattern be drawn repeatedly on a large canvas using nested loops. This sketch is at: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/OcFRS4Tjn

In Q3, we added randomness to our tiled pattern. I chose to add a lot of small randomness such as the position and scale of the fireworks, how big their lines were, and I
also added a firework that could be one of 2 random fireworks. Additionally, I added random stars to make the background look more like the night sky

For Q4, we made a new sketch. The task was to create a pattern that displays sprites on the screen in a set order using arrays. I chose to make a sort of library with books
that had different properties that were laid out in multiple arrays. For example, there were properties for its length, its size, its cover color, and 
the state of its pages. the sketch can be found here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/Xn5wrPgDC
